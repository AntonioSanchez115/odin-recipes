    <p class="description">
        These baked burger dogs, hot dog-shaped burgers that are baked in the oven, are great <br>
        for when the cookout gets rained out, or when you want to impress your guests, or just <br>
        confuse your kids. The taste and texture may remind you of White Castle burgers.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 tablespoons melted butter or oil, divided</li>
            <li>1 1/2 pounds ground beef</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
            <li>1/8 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
            <li>1/3 cup finely diced red onion</li>
            <li>1/3 cup diced dill or sweet pickles, well drained</li>
            <li>6 ounces Cheddar cheese, shredded, divided</li>
            <li>8 hot dog buns</li>
        </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Grease a large 15x10-inch casserole <br>
                    dish with 1 tablespoon melted butter or oil.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Add beef, salt, black pepper, garlic powder, red onion, pickles, and 4 ounces shredded <br>
                    cheese to a bowl, and use a fork to mix until all ingredients are evenly combined.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Divide beef mixture into 8 equal portions. Using damp fingers, shape 1 portion into a <br>
                    log and gently press onto the bottom of a hot dog bun. Lightly press bun together, trapping <br>
                    the meat, and place stuffed bun in the baking dish with meat facing straight up. Repeat <br>
                    until all 8 buns are stuffed.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Brush all exposed areas of buns with remaining 1 tablespoon melted butter or oil, and sprinkle <br>
                    over remaining 2 ounces of cheese.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Bake in the preheated oven until meat is no longer pink at the center, and buns are golden <br>
                    brown and crispy on the edges, about 25 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted near <br>
                    the center should read 160 degrees F (70 degrees C).
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Serve immediately with classic burger and hot dog toppings and condiments.
                </p>
