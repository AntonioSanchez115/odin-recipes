    <p class="description">
        We're turning s'mores into the perfect Father's Day-inspired dessert. Your father <br>
        will associate this pie with so many things men love: building fires, carving pointy <br>
        sticks, scaring things, and so forth. This has the classic three layers of the s'more: <br>
        the graham crackers, chocolate, and toasted marshmallows.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 ½ cups finely crushed graham cracker crumbs</li>
            <li>¼ cup white sugar</li>
            <li>6 tablespoons butter, melted</li>
            <li>1 (28 ounce) package chocolate ice cream, slightly softened</li>
            <li>2 cups miniature marshmallows, or enough to cover the top</li>
        </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Place graham cracker crumbs into a bowl, add sugar and melted butter, and mix until <br>
                well combined. Transfer mixture into a 9-inch pie dish. Gently press graham cracker <br>
                mixture into the bottom and up the sides of the pie dish using a spatula. Pat the edge <br>
                and inside of the crust smooth with your fingers.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>Refrigerate crust until thoroughly chilled, at least 30 minutes.</li>
            <br>
            <li>
                Fill crust with chocolate ice cream using a small ice cream scoop. Smooth the ice cream <br>
                with a spatula. Place a ring of mini marshmallows around the inside of the crust and <br>
                cover top of ice cream with remaining marshmallows. Gently press marshmallows into the <br>
                ice cream.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>Freeze until very firm, at least 2 hours.</li>
            <br>
            <li>
                Use a propane blow torch to toast the marshmallows, moving the torch quickly to brown <br>
                the marshmallows. Marshmallows should have small charred spots. Return to freezer to <br>
                chill the marshmallow topping, at least 3 hours; slice and serve.            
            </li>
